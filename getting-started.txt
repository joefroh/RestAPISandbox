To run this code:

1. fork or clone the repository
2. run npm install on the root directory to pull down all the dependancies
3. generate a 'secrets.js' file with your app id in password. The code expects the following format:
    
    {
        exampleApi: {
            id: 'your id here',
            secret: 'your app secret here'
        }
    }

4. node index.js

Enjoy! All feedback is appreciated :)
